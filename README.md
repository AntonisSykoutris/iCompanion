For the past few years, android/ios applications have exploded in popularity reestablishing/reinventing the way people, connect, exchange information, interact and socialize. In recent years, various studies have been conducted considering Frailty in elderly people. Hence, it is essential to have an android/ios application that could benefit the medical staff in various ways. Therefore, the software to be developed will provide a user-friendly interface that will be comfortable for the users to interact and spend time on, without being hectic, thus elevating the user experience. Moreover, commission-approved questionnaires are present in the software for the medical staff to collect sensitive data. Additionally, these data could help them identify signs of frailty and assess the effectiveness of the treatment. Therefore, the need for such an application is mandatory and due to the lack of such software in the market, it is a prototype idea that could dramatically help in real-world scenarios..
The objective is to develop an android/ios application that will allow users to play medical games and answer daily appropriate questionnaires. Additionally, the android/ios application will provide a calendar section, where the patient can review the answers to the questionnaires. One important aim of this software is to monitor its effectiveness of it using a monthly graph.
